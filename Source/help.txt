Marching Cubes Terrain

A good explanation of the Marching cubes algorithm:
http://www.cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0405/shape/marching_cubes.html

This little app lets you paint 3D shapes via the Marching Cubes algorithm.
The cube world dimension is 30x30x30.

Using the height control widget you select a particular Y axis level of the world,
then you paint flux levels in the companion X/Z view.

Pinch the screen to control zoom, slide 1 finger to rotate, 2 fingers to translate, tap to stop rotation.

All the slider boxes work the same way:
Press and hold to either side of center to affect the parameter in the specfied direction and speed.

A.  Button controls:
Reset : set flux levels of all positions to starting values (all zero except for the 'floor')
Smooth : a convolution is used to smooth out the flux changes between neighboring points.
CopyDown : starting from the top level, copy flux levels to the bottom of the world.
Change Skin : cycle through a list of textures for the mesh.
Scroll Skin : slowly slide the texture across the mesh.
Random Flux : randomly alter the flux levels of all the points.
Skeleton Flux : affect flux levels in strage way

B. Iso Value:   specify the flux 'cut-off' value that determines where the boundaries are drawn
C. Brush Width: how many points are affected when you paint flux levels
   When 'Pencil' is enabled you paint just 1 pixel wide.
D. Ambient light level
E. Drawing mode
    Add :  flux levels are increased as you paint
    Remove : flux levels are decreased as you paint.  Good for carving holds through the world.
    Move : for changing the Y level without drawing as you go.
F.  For those of you who aren't sick the cross-eyed 3D effect, toggle it here.
G.  Height control.  Slide finger up/down this widget to select which point level is painted.
H.  Paint control. Slide finger in this widget to paint flux levels.
